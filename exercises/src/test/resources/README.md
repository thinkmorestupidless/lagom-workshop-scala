exercise_000_initial_state

This exercise shows a minimal Lagom application. This is as close to a "Hello, world!" as we get with Lagom (remember Lagom is designed to create large, distributed microservice-based applications).

The purpose of this initial exercise is to demonstrate:

* The structure of a Lagom application
* The development environment provided by Lagom
* The 'Reactive Platform' tooling for deploying applications.

TASK:

* Complete the implementation of the 'balance' method in `com.example.wallet.impl.WalletServiceImpl` so the tests pass successfully.

* Execute `runAll` to bring up the system locally

* Confirm the `/api/balance/:id` endpoint works correctly
